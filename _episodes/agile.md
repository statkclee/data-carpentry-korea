Hello, and welcome to the third episode of the Software Carpentry
lecture on software engineering. In this episode, we'll have a look at
agile software development, a collection of techniques and practices
that many people believe fit well with how researchers actually work,
and that are a natural step up from what many good practitioners do when
working solo.

The term "agile" was coined in 2001 to describe a "bottom-up" style of
software project management based on short iterations and frequent
feedback from both developers and customers.

Agile development practices are almost as old as programming, but they
came into their own with the rise of the World Wide Web.

First, the web made it possible to "release" software weekly, daily, or
even hourly, since updating a server is a lot faster, and a lot less
expensive, than shipping CDs to thousands of people.

Second, during the 1990s and early 2000s it seemed as if web programming
tools were changing every single day.

Multi-year development plans didn't make a lot of sense when everything
they depended on would be obsolete by the time work started, much less
by the time it finished.

Third, the growth of the web was aided by, and fuelled, the growth of
the open source movement.

People couldn't help noticing that most open source projects didn't have
long-range plans, but nevertheless produced high-quality software faster
than many closed-source commercial projects.

So what is agile software development?

At its heart, it is any methodology that relies on continuous or nearly
continuous feedback.

Agile methods break development down into short iterations, typically no
more than two weeks long, and often as short as a single day.

In each iteration, the team decides what to build next, designs it,
builds it, tests it, and delivers it.

As they're doing this, feedback loops at several scales help them get it
right, and do it better next time.

The iteration itself is the primary feedback loop. Users often don't
know what they want until they see it, so short cycles are a way to
avoid spending too much time building what turns out to be the wrong
thing:

This "exploratory" philosophy is why many people think that agile is a
good way to develop research software. In most cases researchers are
their own users, and often can't know what they should write next until
they've seen the output of the current version of the program.

Short iterations help improve efficiency in two other ways as well.

First, most people can keep track of what they're doing for a few days
at a time without elaborate Gantt charts, so short cycles allow them to
spend proportionally less time coordinating with one another.

Second, finding bugs becomes easier: instead of looking through weeks'
or months' worth of software to find out where the problem is,
developers usually only have to look at what's been written in the last
few days.

So what does agile development look like in practice? Once again, the
key element is feedback loops.

A typical working day starts with a *stand-up meeting* where everyone in
the team reports what they did the day before, what they're planning to
do that day, and what's blocking them (if anything).

It's called a "stand-up" meeting because it's usually held standing up,
which encourages people to stay focused.

For example, suppose Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy are
working on some new mind control software.

Wolfman's report might be:

-   Yesterday: fixed the bug that was making the message file reader
    crash on accented characters, and added code to the web page
    generator to display accented characters properly.
-   Today: will get message file reader to recognize links to images and
    load those images.
-   Blockers: what should the message file reader do if the image is on
    the web instead of local? Should it try to read it, or is that a
    security hole?

Stand-up meetings are another agile feedback loop. Each day, the team
gets feedback on the progress they're making, whether they're still on
track to meet the iteration's goals, whether the technical decisions
they're making are paying off, and so on:

The key to making this work is that each task is at most a day long.

Anything longer is broken into sub-tasks so that there's something
substantial to report at every meeting.

Without this rule, it's all too easy for someone to say, "Still working
on X," several days in a row, which means that feedback, and the
possibility of early course correction, are lost.

Once the stand-up meeting is over, everyone gets back to work.

In many agile teams, this means sitting with a partner and doing *pair
programming*:

![The Pair Programming Loop]({{ site.github.url }}/fig/pair.png)

The "driver", does the typing, while the "navigator" watches and
comments.

Every hour or so, the pair switches roles.

Pair programming is beneficial for several reasons:

*   First, the navigator will often notice mistakes in the driver's
    code, or remember design decisions that the driver is too busy
    typing to recall.  This is the tightest of the feedback loops that
    make agile work, since feedback is nearly continuous.

*   Second, pair programming spreads knowledge around: every piece of
    code has been seen by at least two people, which reduces the risk
    of "But I didn't know" mistakes.

*   Third, it also helps people pick up new skills: if you have just
    seen someone do something with two clicks, you will probably do it
    that way when it's your turn to drive, rather than spending two
    minutes doing it the way you always have.

*   Finally, most people are less likely to check Facebook every five
    minutes if someone else is working with themâ€¦

As well as pair programming, most agile teams use two other practices.

The first is called *test-driven development*, or TDD. This is the
practice of writing unit tests *before* writing application code:

![The TDD Loop]({{ site.github.url }}/fig/tdd.png)

The usual cycle is:

*   write a handful of tests that don't even run because the code they
    are supposed to test doesn't exist yet;
*   write just enough code to make those tests pass;
*   clean up what's just been written; and
*   commit it to version control.

TDD's advocates claim that writing tests first focuses people's minds on
what their code is supposed to before they're psychologically biased in
favor of it being supposed to do whatever they've just written actually
does.

It also helps ensure that code actually *is* testable: all too often, if
someone spends a day writing software, they'll only discover at the end
that there's no easy way to set up tests cases, run them, or check the
results.

The other working practice that most agile teams use is *continuous
integration*:

![The Continuous Integration Loop]({{ site.github.url }}/fig/ci.png)

Every few minutes, or every time someone commits code to the version
control repository, an automated process checks out a clean copy of the
code, builds it, runs all the tests, and posts the results somewhere,
such as a web page.

If any of the tests fail, the continuous integration system notifies
people by sending out email, texting them, or making the red light in
the coffee room start blinking.

We're not kidding about the blinking light: the more obvious it is that
something's broken, the faster people will fix it, and the less likely
they are to shame themselves by breaking it again.

Continuous integration is the reality check that ensures that the
software is always in a runnable state, so that it's always ready to
give to users.

Like TDD, it encourages people to work in small steps, which in turn
makes short iterations possible.

Together, the two practices give developers more feedback: TDD lets them
see how their design decisions are going to play out before they're
committed to a particular implementation, while continuous integration
tells them (and everyone else) when they've forgotten something, or
broken something that was working a moment ago.

So, is agile development right for your project?
As a rough guide, it works best when:

1.  Requirements are constantly changing, i.e., long-range planning
    isn't possible anyway. This is often the case for scientific
    research, particularly at the small scale.

2.  Developers and users can communicate continuously, or at worst
    daily or weekly. Again, this is normal for small-scale research,
    where developers and users are the same people.

3.  The team is small, so that everyone can take part in a single
    stand-up meeting. This is usually also true, though getting
    everyone to show up for a morning meeting is a challenge in many
    labs.

4.  Team members are disciplined enough not to use "agile" as an
    excuse for cowboy coding.

5.  They actually *like* being empowered.

The last two points are the most important.

Most developers don't like writing plans before they code, or
documentation when they're done.  Coincidentally, agile doesn't
require them to do much of either.  It's therefore all too common for
developers to say "we're agile" when what they mean is "we're not
going to bother doing anything we don't want to".

In reality, agile requires *more* discipline, not less, just as
improvising well requires even more musical talent than playing a score
exactly.

On the flip side, many people don't like making decisions. After two
decades of schooling, they want to be told what the assignment is and
exactly what they have to do to get an 'A', a 'B', or whatever grade
they're shooting for.

Many become quite defensive when told that figuring out what to do is
now part of their job, but that's as essential to agile development as
it is to scientific research.
